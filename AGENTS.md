# Codex Adapter — `cografya_web`

Before task actions, read `ENGINEERING.md` completely. It is the provider-neutral,
binding frontend handbook.

For shared process and product state, start from the assigned task context manifest. It
routes you to:

- the orchestration-root `ATLAS-OPERATIONS.md`
- the orchestration-root `CONVENTIONS.md`
- the orchestration-root `SEO-POLICY.md`
- the orchestration-root `CONTENT-STYLE.md` for any reader-facing string
- the exact `TASKS.md` entry when task state matters
- the other root policy sections named by the manifest

The manifest is a starting point, not a ceiling. Read `CONVENTIONS.md`, `SEO-POLICY.md` and `CONTENT-STYLE.md` as far as the task needs;
economise on history ledgers by grepping the heading. **Reading more is not the failure
mode; missing a binding rule is** (→ DEC 2026-08-06w). Any reader-facing string obliges
`CONTENT-STYLE.md`, cited or not.

Codex-specific execution uses the `cografya_frontend_dev` profile from the orchestration
root's `.codex/agents/`. Vera is the single writer. Never edit the sibling
`cografya_api` repo; coordinate OpenAPI contract changes through Atlas.

CI is the only test-suite gate. Use only the local checks allowed by `ENGINEERING.md`.
Do not merge or run the PR-review fan-out; Atlas invokes `$review-pr`.

Prefer launching Codex from `/Users/omercan/Desktop/cografya`. A nested-only launch
loads this adapter but must not assume the parent's project agents/config are discovered;
explicitly add/read the parent before shared-state work, and do not dispatch team roles
until the outer-root configuration is active.
