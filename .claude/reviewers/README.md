# `cografya_web` Reviewer Rubrics

This legacy `.claude/` path is retained for compatibility, but the Markdown content is
provider-neutral and is used by both Claude and Codex.

The orchestration-root `REVIEW-POLICY.md` is the only authority for:

- roster and applicability;
- escalation (model selection is set by the active provider's `review-pr` skill);
- severity;
- output contract;
- validation, deduplication, and report shape;
- author filter and delivery loop.

These files contain the role-specific mandate and checklists only:

- `code-reviewer.md`
- `a11y-reviewer.md`
- `design-fidelity-reviewer.md`
- `security-privacy-reviewer.md`
- `pr-test-analyzer.md`
- `code-simplifier.md`
- `seo-reviewer.md` — retired pointer to FENER

Reviewers never modify code/content/state, delete files, run tests, or touch the
consolidated report. Each may write only the unique raw recovery checkpoint Atlas
assigns under `pr-reviews/`, and returns only the canonical policy's path/hash/count
digest to Atlas. Atlas reads each full checkpoint once and alone writes/checkpoints the
consolidated `pr-reviews/{PR}.md` after every wave.
