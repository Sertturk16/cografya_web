# `data/` — committed static data snapshots

Reference/geographic data that the build reads at **generate time only**. Nothing here is
fetched from a third party during `next build` or at runtime — we own the snapshot so the
build is reproducible and independent of any upstream repo's availability (same "own it,
don't live-fetch it" discipline the platform applies to editorial content; see the api
repo's `data-provenance.md` for the editorial-content ledger this mirrors).

| **Required attribution**   | **© OpenStreetMap katkıcıları, ODbL** — rendered visibly next to every map that ships (see `components/map/`)      |

### Why it is transformed at build time (not shipped as-is)

Per the locked SPEC (`Owner's Inbox/interactive-map-hover-spec/SPEC.md` §5.2 + DEC
2026-07-10): the raw GeoJSON is **never sent to the client**. A one-shot generator projects
and simplifies these polygons into inline SVG `<path>` data
(`scripts/generate-map-paths.mjs` → `lib/map/tr-provinces.generated.ts`). Rendering ODbL data
to a produced SVG work is a lighter licence obligation than distributing the source database,
and it is better for CWV (no map library, no tile requests) and SEO (paths + the province
links land in the first-response HTML). The **ODbL attribution stays visible regardless**.

### The name → plaka-kodu join

The source features carry only a `name` (and some are informal, e.g. `"Afyon"` for
Afyonkarahisar). Province identity in our API is keyed by the stable, unique **plaka kodu**
(`plateCode`). The generator therefore maps each GeoJSON `name` → its official 2-digit plate
code via a hand-verified table (`scripts/generate-map-paths.mjs`), and emits the SVG paths
keyed by `plateCode`. The map component then joins those shapes to live API province data by
plate code — so the source's informal names never reach the UI (the API's `nameTr` is the
display name).

### Regenerating

```
pnpm generate:map
```

Reads this file, rewrites `lib/map/tr-provinces.generated.ts`. Re-run only if the source
snapshot is refreshed (update the "Fetched" date above when you do) or the projection /
simplification parameters change. Both this snapshot **and** the generated artifact are
committed, so CI and runtime never invoke the generator.
